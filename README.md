# argocd-getting-started
* This repo is meant to be used with a blog post for getting started with Argo CD [link pending].
* Argo will read the Kubernetes manifest files contained here to deploy a demo application to Kubernetes.
* Optionally, a Dockerfile is included if readers would like to package their own spring-petclinic instance for further playing
